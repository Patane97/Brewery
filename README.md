# Brewery

**NOTICE**: *This project is still under development and will be fully published onto spigotmc.org when complete. Once this does happen I will upload a short tutorial around this plugin for any Forks or edits. For now however, do keep in mind that this project requires another of my repositories for Utilities: https://github.com/Patane97/PataneUtil*

Brewery is a plugin for Spigot Minecraft Servers which allows users to create new and unique items that do new and unique things! It does this by manipulating and combining regular minecraft mechanics and connecting them to uniquely marked items.

This is my first major Java project I have worked on and has become a huge source of learning in my studies over the past 4-5 years. Over the revisions, I have updated many aspects of the plugin as I learn new things. Theres many more things I would like to implement, however I would like to release the plugin as soon as possible. My final milestone before release is to implement and 'stylise' all of the remaining commands. Once this is complete, I will focus on small features and quality of life changes.
